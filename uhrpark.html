   <footer><h2>ABOUT UHURU PARK</h2>
    <p>Uhuru Park is a 12.9 hectare (32 acre) recreational park adjacent to the central business district of Nairobi, Kenya. It was opened to the general public by the late Mzee Jomo Kenyatta on 23 May 1969. It contains an artificial lake, several national monuments, and an assembly ground which has become a popular skateboarding spot on weekends and also a location for local skateboarding competitions (best trick contest 2017), catering to Nairobi's growing skate scene.[1]

        Apart from skateboarding, the assembly ground is used for occasional political and religious gatherings. It is infamous as the site where protest against illegal land grabbing was violently broken up by the Moi regime. In 2021, the park came under scrutiny for an attempted renovation which included removing old trees. A national court halted the project, due to environmental concerns.[2][3][4] It has been closed since November 2021, when the park was fenced with blue corrugated iron and a green wire fence with sharp spikes. Reopening date is not yet clear.</p>
