    <h4>HISTORY</h4>
    <p>The Kenyatta International Conference Centre, locally known as the "KICC", was commissioned by Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, the first President of the Republic of Kenya, in 1967. It was designed by Karl Henrik NÃ¸stvik architect with David Mutiso.[10][11] The construction was carried out by contractors Solel Boneh & Factah. This was done in three phases. Phase I was the construction of the podium, Phase II consisted of the main tower and Phase III involved the Plenary.[12] Construction was completed in 1973, with the opening ceremony occurring in September 1973 presided over by President Kenyatta. The KICC was then made a State Corporation established under the Tourism Act in 2011, which came into operation on 1 September 2012. Whereas the centre is known as a leading meeting venue in Nairobi, its national mandate following the Act became to nurture and promote the country as a destination most preferred for business travel and MICE tourism. M.I.C.E has been recognized as one of the four key products to be developed under the Kenya Vision 2030.[13]

        In September 2013, as the complex celebrated its 40th anniversary, it was renamed to the Kenyatta International Convention Centre.[14]</p>
